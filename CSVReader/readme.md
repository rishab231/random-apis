## CSVReader

While working on a large dataset in Java, I came across a need to create an efficient way to store CSV files. This API reads in a CSV file for you using Java's *BufferedReader* and stores it as a list of maps from Header (Stored as a String) -> Attribute (which is a wrapper class around either an Integer or a String);

### Prerequisites
All items (Integer, FLoat, Double et all.), including user defined objects can be stored in the array.

```java
public static void main
```

### Running the tests

I have included a ```SparseMatrixTester``` class to test the main class. Feel free to modify it to include tests for your specific 2D array.
