## 1. Sparse Matrix / 2D Array

While working on a large dataset in Java, I came across a need to create an efficient way to create a very sparse matrix i.e. one with a large number of 0/Null/NaN values. This API gives an slightly better alternative way to store and perform operations on such values.

### Prerequisites
All items (Integer, FLoat, Double et all.), including user defined objects can be stored in the array.

```java
public static void main
```

### Running the tests

I have included a ```SparseMatrixTester``` class to test the main class. Feel free to modify it to include tests for your specific 2D array.

#### Test #1: Placeholder

Explain what this test does and why

```java
public static void main()
